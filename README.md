# Personal-Expense-Tracker-and-Predictor-Using-ML
ðŸ“Œ Project Description
Personal Expense Tracker and Predictor Using ML is a smart, AI-powered web application that allows users to track their spending, analyze financial patterns, and receive intelligent advice to manage their money better. The system is designed with both ease of use and powerful analysis in mind, featuring the following key sections:

ðŸ”¹ Manual Transaction Entry
Users can manually enter transaction data using a simple form that includes:

Amount: Total cost of the transaction

Category: Choose from predefined options like Grocery, Entertainment, Transportation, Healthcare, Education, and Others

Date: Only allows current or past dates; future dates are restricted

Description: A short note about the expense


ðŸ”¹ CSV File Upload
Users can upload a .csv file containing bulk transaction data. The file format must match the manual entry structure:
Amount, Category, Date, Description
This allows faster data entry and integration with bank statements or exported expense sheets.

ðŸ”¹ AI-Powered Financial Advice
The backend integrates machine learning algorithms such as:

    K-Means Clustering
  
    Decision Trees

    Linear Regression

These are used to analyze spending patterns and provide financial advice to the user based on behavior and trends.

ðŸ”¹ Recent Transactions
Displays a quick view of the last 10 recorded transactions for convenience.
An "All Transactions" button shows the full transaction history in a separate view.

ðŸ”¹ Visual Expense Analytics
Multiple graphical visualizations are provided for users to better understand their financial habits:

    -Category-wise expenses
  
    -Monthly and Weekly spending

    -Total and average expenses

    -Top categories based on amount spent


Graph buttons are accessible from two locations: under the financial advice section and on the all-transactions page.
